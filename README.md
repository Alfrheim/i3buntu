i3buntu
============

This project is for setting up a minimal Ubuntu installation with the i3 window managing system together with other options that will make the operating system work and look well. The main goal of the project is to construct a flavour of the Ubuntu operating system which
* is minimal in the sense that it should not come with many preinstalled desktop applications like LibreOffice, Solitaire and Rhythmbox
* it should contain all the default repositories plus more to allow for easy installation of most of the typical applications people want access to
* it should come preinstalled with support for Bluetooth devices, WiFi and power management, graphics and network drivers, printers
* the notion of root should be the same as in regular Ubuntu, and one should get a CLI or visual prompt for a password whenever an attempt to make deep changes to the system is made
* the i3 window manager should be the default and only (preinstalled) window manager on the system. A number of customizations should be made in order for it to be both visually attractive and allow for productive workflows.
